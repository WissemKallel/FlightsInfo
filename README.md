# FlightsInfo
I created the FlightsInfo web application that lets the user manage a data base of flights and get extra info about them.
A SQL Server Express LocalDB data base has been pushed to the server (FlightsDBContext.mdf in the App_Data folder), and it only needs a recent version of Visual Studio to work. The database contains an initially empty table of Flights that the user will manage through the UI, as well as two input tables: Airports (contains some airports around the world with real GPS location), as well as an Aircrafts table (which holds fuel consumption data for the different aircraft models). I decided to include the Aircrafts table because the fuel consumption can differ hugely between aircraft models, so it seemed to me that making it constant would be a strong assumption. Although the data in the Aircrafts database are within a reasonable range (according to my research), they are not very accurate as it is hard to find the appropriate information on the internet.
